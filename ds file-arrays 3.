AIM-3.- WRITE A PROGRAM IN C TO IMPLEMENT LINEAR SEARCHING IN 1-D ARRAYS.

PROGRAM- 
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int arr[8] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8};
    int search;
    printf("Enter element you want to search: ");
    scanf("%d", &search);
    int found = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == search) {
            found = 1;
            break;  // Exit the loop once the element is found
        }
    }

    if (found == 1) {
        printf("Your searched element was found");
    } else {
        printf("not found---->");
    }

    return 0;
}
